This project demonstrates how the Atmosphere SIPS team builds their custom instance of [NASA Worldview](https://github.com/nasa-gibs/worldview).

We make use of the python package [worldview-config](https://github.com/asips/worldview-config) to simplify
staying in-sync with the main GIBS instance and applying our own layer configuration.

`layer_config.json` contains a couple layers for demonstration purposes - in practice we maintain a database
containing a table with all our layers and have a script for exporting to a JSON file.
